TITLE(accessing libcurl from Java)
<p>
 We can take advantage of libcurl straight from within Java programs using
 this binding.

<p>
 All you need to do is to get the 'curl-java' package and use it!

<p><b>Download</b><br>

  The original download places have all died and vanished. The source code
  seems to have been rescued and is available here:
<p>
 <a href="https://github.com/pjlegato/curl-java">curl-java</a>

<p><b>Note</b><br> The 'javacurl' project hosted at sourceforge is generally
deemed to be crap. Don't use that.

<p><b>Credits</b><br>

 Daniel Stenberg wrote the original embryo. Guenter Knauf and Patrick Monnerat
 improved it a lot.

 People that have contributed include: Bjorn Reese, Bob Schader, Takeshi
 Martinez, Daniel Marell, Serge Kruppa.

<p>
to test your installation.
in the php install directory run the following command:
<pre>
php.exe -i
</pre>
<p>
the output of this command should be the same as the phpinfo() method - which
is a big HTML listing with all the current settings php is running on.
<p>
if you get any warning messages check the following:
<ul>

<li>
The extensions directory has not been set correctly in the php.ini file to fix
it - make sure there is the following line in your <tt>php.ini</tt> file
extension_dir="c:\php\extensions\" (or the relevant directory string) (I put
the \ on the end because php automagically puts in a / if its not there. I'm
not sure if it has any effect tho. but it did change the warning messages I
was getting.)

<li> Make sure the php_curl.dll file is in that directory. <big><b>Note:</b>
the <i>php_curl.dll</i> is the PHP/CURL binding DLL and is included in the
binary PHP download package for Windows.</big>

<li> Also make sure that the files necessary for curl to run are in the
system[32] directory [32] for non 9x machines.  libeay32.dll ssleay32.dll

<li> make sure that the version of php_curl.dll, php.exe & php4ts.dll is the
same (I found this out by running the installer. and then copying the
php_curl.dll file from the zip package) to fix this replace all the files in
the php install directory with those from the zip package. (theres only 3 or
so)
</ul>

<p>
   The recommended method for configuring these servers is to use
   the REG file incuded with the distribution (pws-php4cgi.reg).
   You may want to edit this file and make sure the extensions and PHP
   install directories match your configuration - once you have done
   this, just double click on the file and it will update your registry.
   Alternatively, you can follow the steps below to do it manually.
<p>
   <b>WARNING</b>:<br>
    These steps involve working directly with the Windows
    registry. One error here can leave your system in an unstable
    state. We highly recommend that you back up your registry
    first. The PHP Development team will not be held responsible if
    you damage your registry.
<p>
   Run Regedit.
<br> Navigate to:
<br>
 <tt>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services/W3Svc/Parameters/ScriptMap</tt>
<p>
   On the edit menu select: New->String Value.
   Type in the extension you wish to use for your php scripts. ex: .php
   Double click on the new string value and enter the path to
   php.exe in the value data field.
   ex: c:\php\php.exe
   Repeat these steps for each extension you wish to associate
   with PHP scripts.
<p>
SUBTITLE(Windows NT/2000 and IIS 4 or newer and PWS 4 on NT Workstation or W2K non server editions)
<p>
   To install PHP on an NT/2000 Server running IIS 4 or newer,
   follow these instructions. You have two options to set up
   PHP, using the CGI binary (php.exe) or with the ISAPI module.
<p>
   In either case, you need to start the Microsoft Management
   Console (may appear as 'Internet Services Manager', either
   in your Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack branch or the Control
   Panel=>Administrative Tools under Windows 2000). Then
   right click on your Web server node (this will most probably
   appear as 'Default Web Server'), and select 'Properties'.
<p>
   If you want to use the CGI binary, do the following:
    Under 'Home Directory', 'Virtual Directory', or
    'Directory', click on the 'Configuration' button,
    and then enter the App Mappings tab.
<p>
    Click Add, and in the Executable box, type:
    c:\php\php.exe (assuming that you have unzipped PHP in c:\php\).
<p>
    In the Extension box, type the file name extension you want
    associated with PHP scripts. Leave 'Method exclusions'
    blank, and check the Script engine checkbox. You may also
    like to check the 'check that file exists' box - for a small
    performance penalty, IIS (or PWS) will check that the script
    file exists and sort out authentication before firing up php.
    This means that you will get sensible 404 style error messages
    instead of cgi errors complaing that php did not output any data.
<p>
    You must repeat from 'Click Add...' for each extension you
    want associated with PHP scripts.
    (.php is recommended. although .phtml and .php3 may be
    required for legacy applications.)
<p>
    Set up the appropriate security. (This is done in Internet
    Service Manager), and if your NT Server uses NTFS file system,
    add execute rights for I_USR_ to the directory that contains
    php.exe

SUBTITLE(To use the ISAPI module do the following)
<p>
    If you don't want to perform HTTP Authentication using PHP,
    you can (and should) skip this step. Under ISAPI Filters,
    add a new ISAPI filter. Use PHP as the filter name, and
    supply a path to the php4isapi.dll.
<p>
    Under 'Home Directory', click on the 'Configuration' button.
    Add a new entry to the Application Mappings. Use the path
    to the php4isapi.dll as the Executable, supply .php as the
    extension, leave Method exclusions blank, and check the
    Script engine checkbox.
<p>
    Stop IIS completely (net stop iisadmin)<br>
    Start IIS again  (net start w3svc)

These versions of the official cURL logo are hi resolution remakes of the
original one[1], made and (c) by Daniel Stenberg.

You are free to use these logos for purposes of showing your use of curl, your
product's use of curl, general or specific curl information, curl advocacy and
similar.

You are allowed to resize the images and host them yourself as you see fit.

The curl-logo.xcf is the canonical source version of the logo, the other
versions are generated using the Gimp image program.

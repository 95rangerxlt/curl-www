                libcurl cookie leak with IP address as domain
                =============================================

Project cURL Security Advisory, September 10th 2014
http://curl.haxx.se/docs/security.html

1. VULNERABILITY

  By not detecting and rejecting domain names for partial literal IP addresses
  properly when parsing received HTTP cookies, libcurl can be fooled to both
  sending cookies to wrong sites and into allowing arbitrary sites to set
  cookies for others.

  For this problem to trigger, the client application must use the numerical
  IP address in the URL to access the site and the site must send back cookies
  to the site using domain= and a partial IP address.

  Since libcurl wrongly approaches the IP address like it was a normal domain
  name, a site at IP address 192.168.0.1 can set cookies for anything ending
  with .168.0.1 thus fooling libcurl to send them also to for example
  127.168.0.1.

  The flaw requires dots to be present in the IP address, which restricts the
  flaw to IPv4 literal addresses or IPv6 addresses using the somewhat unusual
  "dotted-quad" style: "::ffff:192.0.2.128"

  This is not believed to be done by typical sites as this is not supported by
  clients that adhere to the rules of the RFC 6265, and many sites are written
  to explicitly use their own specific named domain when sending cookies.

2. INFO

  Cookie parsing and use is opt-in by applications and is not enabled by
  default.

  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned the name
  CVE-2014-3613 to this issue.

3. AFFECTED VERSIONS

  The IP address flaw has existed ever since libcurl started to support
  cookies.

  Affected versions: from libcurl 7.1 to and including 7.37.1
  Not affected versions: libcurl >= 7.38.0

  libcurl is used by many applications, but not always advertised as such!

4. THE SOLUTION

  libcurl 7.38.0 makes sure that when connected to a site specified with a
  literal IP address, only exact matches are considered for cookies.

  A patch for this problem is available at:

    http://curl.haxx.se/CVE-2014-3613.patch

5. RECOMMENDATIONS

  We suggest you take one of the following actions immediately, in order of
  preference:

  A - Upgrade to curl and libcurl 7.38.0

  B - Apply the patch and rebuild libcurl

  C - Avoid using cookies in your application if you ever use URLs involving
      literal IP addresses.

6. TIME LINE

  It was reported to the curl project on August 15th 2014. We contacted
  distros@openwall on September 1st.

  libcurl 7.38.0 was released on September 10th 2014, coordinated with the
  publication of this advisory.
